GMTEC Group is a consulting company providing expertise in the Automotive sector since 2003. Since the first years of our existence, we have been committed and focused, supporting our Principals mainly in the French and Italian market, facilitating the growth of their Sales. By offering agile and flexible solutions for business development, our mission is to strengthen the Automotive Supplierâ€™s presence in the field and increase the success chances for all the existing opportunities.

## Who we are

We've been active in the automotive sector for over 20 years.
Our cross-disciplinary team provides flexible support for both our principals and end customers, in a wide range of areas including sales, engineering, logistics and quality.
As a true cultural bridge between our Principals and our Customers, we tailor our support to the specific needs of each, bringing constant and lasting value to our partners.

## Our mission

We offer tailor-made Business Development support in the Automotive OE (Original Equipment) sector, with a focus on the French, Italian, Benelux and Spanish marked, adapting ourselves to the needs of our partners.
Once a project has been awarded, we provide program management throughout the development phase, right up to the start of production (SOP), as well as during the series production phase. We intervene effectively in the event of engineering modifications, technical obstacles, quality or logistics issues.
Agile and responsive, we are constantly adapting thanks to our lean organizational structure and the versatility of our team.

Our role goes far beyond simply supporting suppliers' sales teams. We actively contribute to development by :

- Participating in the recruitment of technical profiles, such as resident engineers
- Identifying quality partners for fast, efficient handling of customer complaints
- Facilitating the search for industrial partners via our network, and promoting the creation of joint ventures or operational alliances.
  Finally, we act as a cultural bridge between our international partners and their customers, fostering fluid communication and effective cooperation

## Our vision

To empower our core business within the automotive OE sector, we have been diversifying our activities for around five years with strategic initiatives:
Launching new activities in advanced R&D
Continuously learn on new technologies, new regulations and new market tendencies
Promotion of technologies not limited to the OE Automotive sector, but also for systems and components in the Agricultural, Industrial and Independent Aftermarket (IAM) areas.
Enlarge our presence in EMEA and in new Continents via opening of new offices or via partnerships.
Our ambition: to become the most efficient and reliable local partner for suppliers to the automotive, agricultural and industrial sectors, with a presence that extends well beyond the European market.

# Group (About page)

## Why outsource ?

Entrusting your sales force to a specialized partner transforms fixed costs into variable costs, guarantees immediate access to seasoned sales people and frees up your in-house teams to focus on innovation and operations. You gain in flexibility, reduce your structural costs and get your offers to market faster.

## WHEN IS IT RELEVANT ?

SMEs: lack of time, budget or expertise to set up and manage a full sales team.
Technology companies: need to convert innovation into sales without diverting R&D.
Companies in export or expansion phase: rapidly penetrate a new market without creating a local structure.
Established groups: benchmark internal performance, launch a strategic product or explore a new sector.

## MAJOR ADVANTAGES

Multi-channel prospecting, in-depth lead qualification, event-driven acceleration plans, contract negotiation and conclusion, key account follow-up and opening of new territories.
Reduced sales costs, instant adaptation of resources to market fluctuations, access to experienced talent without recruitment delays, and operational deployment in a matter of weeks.

## OUR PARTNERS

At GMTEC, we support a wide range of partners, from international groups to mid-sized companies. Whatever their profile, we provide them with on-the-ground expertise, a tailor-made approach and the proximity they need to boost their commercial effectiveness in Europe.
We build long-term relationships based on trust, transparency and concrete results.
Our added value lies in our ability to bridge the gap between cultures, teams and technical issues, facilitating exchanges and the development of ambitious projects.
